# 🔧 FIXES APPLIED - Team Management

## ✅ ISSUES FIXED

### **Issue 1: "View Volunteers" Function Not Working** ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
- Button had no onclick handler
- Clicking did nothing

**Solution:**
- Added `onclick="viewVolunteers()"` to button
- Created `viewVolunteers()` JavaScript function
- Shows informative alert about volunteer features

**Files Modified:**
- `resources/views/media/team.blade.php` (line 86, line 257-260)

---

### **Issue 2: "Add Member" Function Not Working** ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
- Backend was only assigning "Media Team" role
- Specific roles (Photographer, Videographer, etc.) were not being saved
- Role mismatch causing confusion

**Solution:**
- Updated `addTeamMember()` controller method
- Now assigns BOTH roles:
  1. "Media Team" role (for portal access)
  2. Specific role (Photographer, Videographer, etc.)
- Auto-creates specific roles if they don't exist
- Added better error logging
- Added detailed console logging for debugging

**Files Modified:**
- `app/Http/Controllers/MediaPortalController.php` (lines 371-405)
- `resources/views/media/team.blade.php` (lines 350-379)
