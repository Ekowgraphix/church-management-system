# ✅ MEMBER VS STAFF VIEWS - COMPLETE!

## 🎯 **The Solution**

## 👥 **What Church Members See**

✅ **Member View Features:**
- Beautiful event cards
- Filter by type & status
- Event details (date, location, capacity)
- **"View Details & RSVP"** button
- ❌ NO "Create Event" button
- ❌ NO "Edit" or "Delete" options

### **Event Details Page (`/events/{id}`)**
✅ **Member View Features:**

## 👔 **What Staff See**

### **Events Page (`/events`)**
✅ **Staff Management Features:**

## 🔧 **How It Works**

The system now checks the user's role in the controller:

```php
if (auth()->user()->hasRole('Church Member')) {
    return view('events.member-index', compact('events'));  // Member view
}

return view('events.index', compact('events'));  // Staff view
```
