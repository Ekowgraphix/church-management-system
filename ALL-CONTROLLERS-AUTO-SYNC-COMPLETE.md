# ✅ ALL CONTROLLERS AUTO-SYNC COMPLETE!

## 🎉 SYSTEM-WIDE AUTO-SYNC INSTALLED!

I've added **automatic storage sync** to **ALL controllers** with file uploads across your entire Church Management System!

## 💾 CODE STRUCTURE:

### **Trait Structure:**
```php
namespace App\Traits;

trait SyncsStorage
{
    protected function syncStorageToPublic()
    {
        // Detects OS and runs appropriate command
        // Falls back to PHP copy if needed
    }
    
    protected function recursiveCopy($source, $destination)
    {
        // Fallback copy using PHP File facade
    }
}
```

### **Controller Usage:**
```php
use App\Traits\SyncsStorage;

class MemberController extends Controller
{
    use SyncsStorage;
    
    public function store(Request $request)
    {
        // ... save file ...
        
        // Auto-sync!
        $this->syncStorageToPublic();
        
        // ... redirect ...
    }
}
```
