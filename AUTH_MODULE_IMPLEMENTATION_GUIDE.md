## ⚙️ Configuration Notes

### **Role-Based Redirects**
Defined in `AuthController@redirectByRole()`:
- **Admin** → `/dashboard`
- **Pastor** → `/dashboard`
- **Ministry Leader** → `/dashboard`
- **Volunteer** → `/dashboard`
- **Organization** → `/dashboard`
- **Church Member** → `/portal` (Member Portal)

### **Email Verification Token**
- **Length:** 60 characters (random)
- **Expiration:** 24 hours
- **Stored in:** `email_verifications` table

### **Password Requirements**
- Minimum 8 characters
- Must be confirmed during signup

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Issue: Verification email not sent**
**Solution:** Check `.env` mail configuration and test with:
```bash
php artisan tinker
Mail::raw('Test', function($msg) { $msg->to('test@example.com')->subject('Test'); });
```

### **Issue: "Class Role not found"**
**Solution:** Make sure Spatie Permission package is installed:
```bash
composer require spatie/laravel-permission
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\Permission\PermissionServiceProvider"
php artisan migrate
```

### **Issue: Login redirects to dashboard instead of portal**
**Solution:** Check that user has "Church Member" role and `redirectByRole()` is working correctly.

### **Issue: Member profile not found after login**
**Solution:** Ensure member record exists with same email as user account.
