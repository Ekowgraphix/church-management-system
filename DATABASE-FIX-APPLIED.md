## 🛠️ FIXES APPLIED

### 1. Created Migration
**File**: `database/migrations/2025_10_17_102938_create_equipment_maintenances_table.php`

**Table Structure**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE equipment_maintenances (
    id                      INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
    equipment_id            INTEGER (Foreign Key -> equipment.id)
    maintenance_date        DATE
    maintenance_type        ENUM('routine','repair','inspection','upgrade')
    description             TEXT
    cost                    DECIMAL(10,2) NULLABLE
    performed_by            VARCHAR NULLABLE
    vendor                  VARCHAR NULLABLE
    notes                   TEXT NULLABLE
    next_maintenance_date   DATE NULLABLE
    recorded_by             INTEGER (Foreign Key -> users.id) NULLABLE
    created_at              DATETIME
    updated_at              DATETIME
)
```

### 2. Verified Model
**File**: `app/Models/EquipmentMaintenance.php`

**Features**:
- ✅ Fillable fields defined
- ✅ Date casting configured
- ✅ Relationships set up (equipment, recordedBy)
- ✅ Proper namespace

### 3. Verified Equipment Model Relationship
**File**: `app/Models/Equipment.php`

**Relationship**:
```php
public function maintenanceRecords()
{
    return $this->hasMany(EquipmentMaintenance::class);
}
```

### 4. Ran Migration
```bash
php artisan migrate
✅ Table created successfully
```

### 5. Cleared Cache
```bash
php artisan optimize:clear
✅ All caches cleared
```
