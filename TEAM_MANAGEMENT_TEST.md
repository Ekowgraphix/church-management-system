## 🐛 COMMON ISSUES & FIXES

### **Issue 1: Page doesn't load / 404 Error**

**Cause:** Route not found

**Fix:**
```bash
php artisan route:clear
php artisan cache:clear
```

Then refresh browser (Ctrl + F5)

---

### **Issue 2: Modal doesn't open**

**Cause:** JavaScript not loading

**Fix:**

Check browser console (F12) for errors. Should see no red errors.

If you see errors, clear view cache:
```bash
php artisan view:clear
```

---

### **Issue 3: Form submission fails**

**Cause:** API endpoint or CSRF token issue

**Check:** Browser Console (F12) → Network tab

Look for POST request to `/media/team/add`
- Should show status 200 (success)
- If 419: CSRF token expired → Refresh page
- If 500: Server error → Check logs

### **Issue 4: "Call to undefined method"**

**Cause:** Spatie roles package issue

**Fix:**
```bash
composer require spatie/laravel-permission
php artisan migrate
```

    return view('media.team', compact('mediaTeamMembers'));
}
```
