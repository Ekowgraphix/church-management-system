## What Needs to Be Done ⏳

### Option 1: Manual Update (Direct Approach)
For each of the 5 portal layouts, you need to:

1. Open the portal layout file
2. Replace everything from `<style>` to `</style>` with admin portal CSS
3. Update the navigation section with portal-specific routes
4. Change portal name in logo section
5. Update top bar role display
6. Keep same HTML structure as admin

### Option 2: Use Cascade (Recommended)
Ask Cascade to:
> "Update [portal name] layout file with admin portal styling while keeping its specific navigation items"

Do this for each portal:
- Pastor portal
- Ministry Leader portal
- Organization portal
- Volunteer portal
- Member portal

### Option 3: Copy-Paste Template
1. Copy `resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php`
2. Save as each portal layout name
3. Manually replace navigation items
4. Update portal titles
5. Change role names

## Quick Implementation Guide

### For Each Portal:

**Step 1**: Backup existing file
```bash
cp resources/views/layouts/[portal].blade.php resources/views/layouts/[portal].blade.php.backup
```

**Step 2**: Update the file with:
- Complete admin CSS (lines 13-533)
- Portal-specific navigation
- Portal name in logo
- Portal subtitle
- Role name in top bar

**Step 3**: Test the portal
- Login with appropriate role
- Verify styling loads
- Check animations
- Test navigation
- Verify responsiveness
