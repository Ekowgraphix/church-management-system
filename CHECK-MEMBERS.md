# 🔍 MEMBER ID 22 ISSUE

## ❌ PROBLEM

The URL `http://127.0.0.1:8000/members/22` is not working because **member with ID 22 doesn't exist**.

---

## ✅ SOLUTION

### **Option 1: View Existing Members**

Go to the members list to see all available members:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/members
```

This will show you all 21 members with their actual IDs.

### **Option 2: Create Member ID 22**

Create a new member to get ID 22:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/members/create
```

Fill in the form and submit. The new member will likely get ID 22.

### **Option 3: View Existing Member**

Try viewing an existing member (IDs 1-21):
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/members/1
http://127.0.0.1:8000/members/2
http://127.0.0.1:8000/members/3
...
http://127.0.0.1:8000/members/21
```

## 📊 CURRENT DATABASE

Based on the seeding:
- **Total Members:** 21
- **Valid IDs:** 1 through 21
- **ID 22:** Does not exist yet

---

## 🎯 QUICK FIX

### **To see all members:**
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/members
```

### **To create member #22:**
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/members/create
```

---

## ✅ VERIFICATION

The member show page (`/members/{id}`) works perfectly. The issue is simply that you're trying to access a member ID that doesn't exist yet.

**The system is working correctly!** ✅

## 💡 TIP

Always check the members list first to see which IDs exist:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/members
```

Then click on any member to view their details.
