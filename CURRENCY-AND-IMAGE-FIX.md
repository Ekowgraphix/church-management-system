## üì∏ IMAGE UPLOAD FIX

### What Was Wrong
The image upload wasn't working because:
1. Storage directory structure not fully created
2. Storage symlink configuration needed verification

### What I Fixed

#### 1. Created Storage Directory
```bash
‚úÖ Created: storage/app/public/equipment/images/
```

#### 2. Verified Controller Configuration
**File**: `app/Http/Controllers/EquipmentController.php`

Both `store()` and `update()` methods properly configured:
```php
// Store method
if ($request->hasFile('image')) {
    $validated['image'] = $request->file('image')->store('equipment/images', 'public');
}

// Update method
if ($request->hasFile('image')) {
    if ($equipment->image) {
        Storage::disk('public')->delete($equipment->image);
    }
    $validated['image'] = $request->file('image')->store('equipment/images', 'public');
}
```

#### 3. Verified Model Configuration
**File**: `app/Models/Equipment.php`
- ‚úÖ 'image' field in fillable array
- ‚úÖ Proper configuration for file storage
