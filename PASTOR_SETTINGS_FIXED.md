# Pastor Portal Settings Page - Fixed ✅

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ Image Upload Not Working
**Problem:** Photo uploads were failing  
**Root Causes:**
- Directory `public/uploads/profiles` didn't exist
- No error handling if directory missing
- No instant preview feedback

**Fixes Applied:**
- **Auto-create directory**: Controller now creates `uploads/profiles` folder automatically if it doesn't exist
- **Added instant preview**: Photo preview shows immediately when image is selected
- **Client-side validation**: File type and size validation before upload
  - Only accepts JPG, PNG, GIF
  - Max size: 2MB
- **Better error messages**: Clear feedback if upload fails
- **Visual improvements**: Added camera icon and border to photo

**Technical Changes:**
```php
// PastorPortalController.php - uploadPhoto()
$uploadPath = public_path('uploads/profiles');
if (!file_exists($uploadPath)) {
    mkdir($uploadPath, 0777, true);
}
```

### 2. ✅ Theme Not Working
**Problem:** Theme selection wasn't applying any visual changes  
**Root Cause:** JavaScript saved theme to localStorage but no CSS was applying the theme classes

**Fixes Applied:**
- **Added theme CSS**: Created `.theme-light` and `.theme-dark` classes
- **Improved toggle styling**: Beautiful toggle switches for notifications
- **Persistent theme**: Theme saved in browser localStorage
- **Auto-apply on load**: Theme applies automatically when page loads
- **Visual feedback**: Toast notification when theme changes

**CSS Added:**
```css
body.theme-light {
    background: #f3f4f6 !important;
}

body.theme-light .bg-white {
    background: white !important;
    color: #1f2937 !important;
}
```

**Toggle Switches:** Custom-styled checkboxes with smooth animations

### 3. ✅ Update Password Not Working
**Problem:** Password change form wasn't providing feedback  
**Root Causes:**
- Generic error messages
- Unclear validation requirements
- No success confirmation

**Fixes Applied:**
- **Custom validation messages**: 
  - "The current password is incorrect. Please try again."
  - "The new password confirmation does not match."
  - "The new password must be at least 8 characters."
- **Clear requirements**: Min 8 characters, requires confirmation
- **Better success message**: "Password changed successfully! Please use your new password next time you log in."
- **Improved error handling**: Specific field-level errors

**Validation Enhanced:**
```php
$request->validate([
    'current_password' => 'required',
    'new_password' => 'required|min:8|confirmed',
], [
    'new_password.confirmed' => 'The new password confirmation does not match.',
    'new_password.min' => 'The new password must be at least 8 characters.',
    'current_password.required' => 'Please enter your current password.',
]);
```
