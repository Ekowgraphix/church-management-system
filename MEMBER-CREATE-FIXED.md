# ✅ MEMBER CREATION FIXED!

## 🎉 **PROBLEM SOLVED!**

I fixed the issue with creating new members. The "Save Member" button now works perfectly!

---

## 🔧 **WHAT I FIXED:**

### **1. Model Issue** ✅
- Added `qr_code` and `last_qr_scan` to fillable fields
- These fields exist in database but weren't fillable

### **2. Default Status** ✅
- Added automatic `membership_status = 'active'` for new members
- No need to manually set status

### **3. Error Display** ✅
- Added error message display to form
- Now you can see what went wrong if validation fails

### **4. Form Enhancement** ✅
- Added `enctype="multipart/form-data"` for file uploads
- Ready for profile photo uploads
