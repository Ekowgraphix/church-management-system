## 🔧 Solutions Implemented

### 1. DashboardController - Graceful Degradation
**Approach**: Show 0 for missing features

**Methods Added**:
- `safeCount()` - Returns 0 if table doesn't exist
- `safeMonthCount()` - Returns 0 for monthly counts

**Result**: Dashboard loads successfully, shows real data for existing features, 0 for missing ones

---

### 2. OfferingController - Redirect to Donations
**Approach**: Redirect users to Donations page with informative message

**Methods Fixed**:
- `index()` - Wrapped in try-catch, redirects to donations
- `create()` - Wrapped in try-catch, redirects to donations
- `store()` - Wrapped in try-catch, redirects to donations

**Result**: Users attempting to access Offerings are redirected to Donations with helpful message:
> "Offerings feature is not yet set up. You can manage offerings through the Donations page."

---

### 3. TitheController - Redirect to Donations
**Approach**: Same as Offerings, redirect to Donations page

**Methods Fixed**:
- `index()` - Wrapped in try-catch, redirects to donations

**Result**: Users attempting to access Tithes are redirected to Donations with helpful message:
> "Tithes feature is not yet set up. You can manage tithes through the Donations page."

## 🔄 How to Activate Missing Features (Optional)

If you want to activate the missing features in the future:

### Option 1: Use Donations for Everything
**Current Setup**: Works perfectly for tithes, offerings, and all donations
- Donations has `donation_type` field that can be: tithe, offering, pledge, etc.
- All financial giving is tracked in one place
- Simpler to manage
- **Recommended approach**

### Option 2: Create Separate Tables
If you really need separate Offerings and Tithes tables:

1. Create simple migrations for offerings and tithes tables
2. Run migrations
3. The controllers will automatically start working
4. Remove redirect logic from controllers
