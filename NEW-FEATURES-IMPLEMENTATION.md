## 💡 **Recommendation**

**I suggest we implement Option 2:**

1. ✅ Migrations created (DONE)
2. Create basic CRUD controllers (30 min)
3. Create simple list views (30 min)
4. Add routes (10 min)
5. Test basic functionality (20 min)

**Total Time: ~2 hours for all 5 new features**

Then you can:
- Use the system immediately
- Enhance UI gradually
- Add advanced features as needed
