# ✅ REDIRECT LOOP - FIXED!

## 🔍 The Problem

**Error:** `ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS` when accessing http://127.0.0.1:8000/portal

## 🎯 Root Cause

**Infinite redirect loop:**
1. Church Member → `/portal`
2. If issue: redirect to `/dashboard` (MemberOnly middleware)
3. `/dashboard` → sees Church Member → redirect to `/portal` (StaffOnly middleware)
4. **LOOP!** Back to step 1

## ✅ The Fix

**Changed:** `MemberOnly` middleware redirect
- **Before:** Redirected to `dashboard` (which has staff.only middleware)
- **After:** Redirects to `login` instead
- **Result:** No more loop!

## 📝 Technical Details

### Files Modified:
- `app/Http/Middleware/MemberOnly.php`

### Change Made:
```php
// Before (caused loop):
if (!auth()->user()->hasRole('Church Member')) {
    return redirect()->route('dashboard')
        ->with('error', 'This area is for church members only.');
}

// After (fixed):
if (!auth()->user()->hasRole('Church Member')) {
    return redirect()->route('login')
        ->with('error', 'This area is for church members only. Please login with a church member account.');
}
```

### Why This Fixes It:
- No longer redirects to `/dashboard`
- `/dashboard` has `staff.only` middleware that would redirect Church Members back to `/portal`
- Now redirects to `/login` which breaks the loop

## 🎉 Status: FIXED!

**All cleared:**
- ✅ Route cache cleared
- ✅ Config cache cleared
- ✅ Application cache cleared
- ✅ Middleware updated

**Just clear your browser cookies and login again!**
