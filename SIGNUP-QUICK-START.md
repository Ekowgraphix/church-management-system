---

## 🎯 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Test New Signup

1. **Open your browser** and go to:
   ```
   http://localhost/churchmang/public/signup
   ```

2. **Fill out the form** (all fields with * are required)

3. **Click "Create Account"**

4. **You'll see:** "Account created successfully!" message

### Step 2: Get Verification Link

**Choose ONE method:**

#### Method A: From Log File (Easiest)
```bash

notepad storage\logs\laravel.log

# Look for this line near the bottom:
[2025-10-19 ...] local.ERROR: Verification URL for email@example.com: http://localhost/churchmang/public/verify-email/[token]

# Copy that URL and paste it in your browser
```

#### Method B: Manual Verification (Fastest)
```bash
# Run the tool
php manual-verify-user.php

# Type: 1
# Enter the user number
# Confirmed!
```

### Step 3: Login
1. Go to: http://localhost/churchmang/public/login
2. Select "**Church Member**" role
3. Enter your email and password
4. Click "Sign In" - **Success!** 🎉

## 🔧 Fix the 7 Existing Unverified Users

You have 7 users that were created but not verified:
- Admin User
- Pastor Jeremy Ekow  
- Ministry Leader Sarah
- Organization Admin
- 2 Volunteers
- 1 Church Member

**To verify them all at once:**

```bash
php manual-verify-user.php
```

When prompted:
- Type: **2** (Verify ALL users)
- Type: **yes** (to confirm)
- Done! All 7 users are now verified ✅

**Or verify one at a time:**
- Type: **1**
- Enter user number (1-7)
- Confirmed!

## 📖 How It Works Now

### Signup Flow:
```
User fills form → Account created → Email sent to log file
                                 ↓
                    User gets success message
                                 ↓
                    Verification link in log file
                                 ↓
              User clicks link OR manual verification
                                 ↓
                        Account verified ✅
                                 ↓
                           User can login!
```

### What's Different:
- ✅ **Before:** Email failure = Signup failure
- ✅ **Now:** Email failure = Signup success + warning message
- ✅ **Before:** No way to verify without email
- ✅ **Now:** Multiple verification methods available
