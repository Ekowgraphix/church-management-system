# ✅ QR CHECK-IN ACCESS FIXED!

## 🎯 THE PROBLEM

The QR Check-In page was **NOT accessible** to members because it was in the **wrong middleware group**!

### What Was Wrong:
```
QR Scanner route was in: staff.only middleware
Members needed access but: member.only middleware
Result: Members got "403 Forbidden" or redirect
```

---

## ✅ THE FIX

Moved the QR Check-In routes to the **member.only middleware group** so members can access them!

### Changed From:
```php
// Inside staff.only middleware group (line 316)
Route::get('qr-checkin/service/scanner', ...)
```

### Changed To:
```php
// Inside member.only middleware group (line 119)
Route::middleware(['auth', 'member.only'])->group(function () {
    ...
    // QR Check-In for Members (Service Scanner)
    Route::get('qr-checkin/service/scanner', [QRCheckInController::class, 'showServiceScanner'])->name('qr.service.scanner');
    Route::post('qr-checkin/service/process', [QRCheckInController::class, 'processServiceCheckIn'])->name('qr.service.process');
});
```

---

## ✅ WHAT'S FIXED

1. ✅ **Members can now access QR Check-In page**
2. ✅ **Route added to member.only middleware**
3. ✅ **Process check-in route also accessible**
4. ✅ **Routes cleared and updated**
5. ✅ **Sidebar link now works**
