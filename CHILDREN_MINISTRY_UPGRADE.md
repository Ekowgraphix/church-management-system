```

### Step 3: Test the Upgraded Page

Or create a test route:
```php
Route::get('/children-ministry/upgraded', function() {
    $children = \App\Models\ChildrenMinistry::paginate(20);
    $stats = [
        'total' => \App\Models\ChildrenMinistry::count(),
        'present_today' => rand(40, 60),
        'attendance_rate' => rand(75, 95),
        'classes' => 5,
        'teachers' => 8,
        'birthdays' => 3,
        'milestones' => 12,
    ];
    return view('children-ministry.index-upgraded', compact('children', 'stats'));

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Images Not Showing
Run the storage sync:
```bash
php artisan storage:link
# or
xcopy storage\app\public public\storage /E /I /Y /Q
```

### Statistics Showing Zero
The controller is using sample data. Update `ChildrenController@index` with actual queries:
```php
$stats = [
    'total' => ChildrenMinistry::count(),
    'present_today' => ChildrenAttendance::whereDate('date', today())
                        ->where('status', 'Present')->count(),
    'attendance_rate' => // Calculate actual percentage
    // ... etc
];
```

### Partials Not Found
Ensure all partial files exist in:
`resources/views/children-ministry/partials/`

---

## 📝 Customization

### Change Age Groups
Edit `partials/age-groups.blade.php`:
```php
@foreach([
    ['icon' => 'baby', 'name' => 'Your Group', 'age' => '0-3', ...],
    // Add more groups
] as $group)
```

### Modify Point Values
Update in `partials/scripts.blade.php`:
```javascript
// Points system
'• Perfect attendance: 10 pts\n' +
'• Memory verses: 20 pts\n' +
// Modify values here
```

### Custom Milestones
Add to database seeder or admin panel:
```php
ChildrenMilestone::create([
    'milestone_type' => 'Custom Achievement',
    'title' => 'Your Custom Milestone',
    'points_awarded' => 50,
]);
```
