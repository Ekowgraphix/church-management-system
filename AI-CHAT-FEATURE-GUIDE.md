# 🤖 AI Chat Feature - Complete Guide

## 🎯 What Was Wrong

The AI Chat controller existed but had incorrect view paths:
- ❌ Controller was looking for `chat.index`
- ✅ Views were actually in `ai-chat/` folder

### What I Fixed:
1. ✅ Updated all view paths to use `ai-chat.index` instead of `chat.index`
2. ✅ Added error handling for missing services
3. ✅ Added `send()`, `history()`, and `clear()` methods
4. ✅ Created simple AI response generator
5. ✅ Cleared all caches

Find the `generateSimpleResponse()` method:

private function generateSimpleResponse($message)
{
    $message = strtolower($message);
    
    // Add your custom keywords here
    if (str_contains($message, 'your_keyword')) {
        return "Your custom response here";
    }
    
    // Add more conditions...
}
```

**Example - Add Bible Study Topic:**
```php
if (str_contains($message, 'bible study') || str_contains($message, 'scripture')) {
    return "I can help you plan Bible studies, find scripture references, and organize study groups. What do you need?";
}
```
