# ✅ REDIRECT ISSUE FIXED!

## 🎯 THE PROBLEM

**QR Check-In page was redirecting to dashboard!**

### Root Cause:
The route `qr.service.scanner` was defined **TWICE**:
1. ✅ In `member.only` middleware group (correct)
2. ❌ In `staff.only` middleware group (DUPLICATE!)

The second definition **overwrote** the first one, so when members tried to access it, the `staff.only` middleware blocked them and redirected to dashboard!

---

## ✅ THE FIX

**Removed the duplicate routes from the staff section!**

### Before:
```php
// In member.only middleware (line 119)
Route::get('qr-checkin/service/scanner', ...)  ✅

// In staff.only middleware (line 320) - DUPLICATE!
Route::get('qr-checkin/service/scanner', ...)  ❌ OVERWRITES ABOVE
```

### After:
```php
// ONLY in member.only middleware (line 119)
Route::get('qr-checkin/service/scanner', ...)  ✅
Route::post('qr-checkin/service/process', ...) ✅

// Removed from staff.only section ✅
```

---

## ✅ VERIFICATION

```
Route: qr.service.scanner
Middleware: web, auth, member.only ✅ CORRECT!
URI: /qr-checkin/service/scanner
Methods: GET, HEAD
```

**No more staff.only blocking members!**

## 💡 WHY IT WAS REDIRECTING

### The Flow:

```
1. User clicks "QR Check-In"
2. Goes to: /qr-checkin/service/scanner
3. Laravel checks route middleware
4. Found: staff.only (from duplicate route)
5. User is Church Member (not Staff)
6. Middleware: "Not authorized!"
7. Redirects to dashboard
```

### Now Fixed:

```
1. User clicks "QR Check-In"
2. Goes to: /qr-checkin/service/scanner
3. Laravel checks route middleware
4. Found: member.only ✅
5. User is Church Member ✅
6. Middleware: "Authorized!"
7. Page loads! ✅
```

## 🚀 TRY IT RIGHT NOW!

1. **Hard refresh:** `Ctrl + F5`
2. **Click:** "QR Check-In" in sidebar
3. **Should load!** No redirect!
