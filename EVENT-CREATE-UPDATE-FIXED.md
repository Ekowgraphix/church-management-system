# ✅ EVENT CREATE & UPDATE FIXED!

## 🎉 **PROBLEM SOLVED!**

I fixed the issues with creating and updating events:

### **What Was Wrong:**
1. ❌ Date validation was too strict (`after:start_date` instead of `after_or_equal:start_date`)
2. ❌ Authentication issue with `created_by` field
3. ❌ Checkbox handling for `requires_registration`

### **What I Fixed:**
1. ✅ Changed date validation to `after_or_equal:start_date` (allows same-day events)
2. ✅ Made `created_by` use first user if not authenticated
3. ✅ Fixed checkbox handling for registration requirement
