# Profile Images Display Update

## Changes Made

Updated all locations throughout the member portal to display profile photos instead of just initials.

### Files Modified:

#### 1. **Dashboard Welcome Section**
**File:** `resources/views/portal/index.blade.php`
- Now shows actual profile photo in the welcome banner
- Falls back to initial if no photo uploaded

#### 2. **Header Profile Picture** 
**File:** `resources/views/layouts/member-portal.blade.php`
- Top-right header now displays user's profile photo
- Shows in all pages (persistent across portal)

#### 3. **Recent Messages Widget**
**File:** `resources/views/portal/index.blade.php`
- Chat partner photos now display in recent messages
- Dynamically loads member photo for each chat partner

#### 4. **Chat User List**
**File:** `resources/views/chat/members.blade.php`
- Member photos displayed in the chat sidebar
- Each user shows their actual photo if uploaded

#### 5. **Chat Conversation Header**
**File:** `resources/views/chat/members.blade.php`
- When opening a chat, the header shows the user's photo
- JavaScript dynamically updates based on selected user

## How It Works

### Image Display Logic:
```php
@if($member && $member->photo)
    <img src="{{ asset('storage/' . $member->photo) }}" 
         alt="{{ $member->name }}"
         class="w-12 h-12 rounded-full object-cover">
@else
    <div class="w-12 h-12 rounded-full bg-gradient-to-br from-green-400 to-green-600">
        {{ strtoupper(substr($member->name, 0, 1)) }}
    </div>
@endif
```

### Storage Path:
- Images stored in: `storage/app/public/members/photos/`
- Accessed via: `asset('storage/[path]')`

## Locations Updated:

| Location | Before | After |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Dashboard Welcome | Letter "B" | Profile Photo |
| Header Bar | Letter "B" | Profile Photo |
| Recent Messages | Letter Initials | Profile Photos |
| Chat User List | Letter Initials | Profile Photos |
| Chat Header | Letter Initial | Profile Photo |

## Upload Instructions

To update your profile photo:
1. Go to **My Profile** from sidebar
2. Click the **camera icon** on your photo
3. Select an image (max 2MB)
4. Click **Update Profile** button
5. Photo will appear everywhere immediately

## Technical Details

### Member-User Relationship:
- Users authenticate via `users` table
- Member data stored in `members` table
- Linked by email address
- Query: `Member::where('email', auth()->user()->email)->first()`

### Dynamic Loading:
- PHP queries member photo on page load
- JavaScript updates chat header dynamically
- All images use `rounded-full` for circular display
- Border styling matches color scheme (green)

## Browser Cache Note

If you uploaded a photo but still see initials:
- **Hard refresh:** Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
- **Clear browser cache** for the site
- **Check storage link:** Run `php artisan storage:link`

## Fallback Behavior

The system gracefully handles missing photos:
- If `photo` column is NULL → Shows initial
- If file doesn't exist → Shows initial
- If image fails to load → Shows initial
- Provides consistent UX regardless of photo status

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding:
- Default avatar images (male/female)
- Photo upload directly from dashboard
- Image cropping tool before upload
- Thumbnail generation for performance
- Cloud storage integration (AWS S3)
