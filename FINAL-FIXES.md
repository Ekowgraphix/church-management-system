## Remaining Items:

### Mark Attendance
The attendance feature needs services to be created. Since there's no services table migration, attendance marking will need to be done directly on members.

### Send SMS
SMS sending requires SMS gateway integration (like Twilio, AfricasTalking, etc.). The interface is ready but needs API configuration.

### Reports
Reports pages exist but need data aggregation logic.
