# 🔧 MEMBER PORTAL - Navigation Links Issue

## 🎯 The Problem

The member portal sidebar is using **staff-only** routes:
- `events.index` → Staff only
- `chat.index` → Staff only  
- `devotional.index` → Staff only
- `prayer-requests.index` → Staff only
- `ai.chat` → Staff only
- `notifications.index` → Staff only
- `members.index` → Staff only

When Church Members click these links, the `staff.only` middleware redirects them, showing the dashboard instead.

## ✅ Quick Fix Options

### **Option 1: Keep Only Working Links (Simplest)**
Remove non-working links and keep only:
- ✅ Home (portal.index)
- ✅ My Profile (portal.profile)
- ✅ My Giving (portal.giving)
- ✅ My Attendance (portal.attendance)

### **Option 2: Add Member Access to Features (Best)**
Move these routes out of `staff.only` into a shared middleware group so members can access them.

### **Option 3: Create Member-Specific Routes**
Create separate controllers/routes for member versions of these features.

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE FIX (Option 1)

I'll update the sidebar to show only working links for now.

### What You'll Keep:
- ✅ **Home** - Your dashboard
- ✅ **My Profile** - Edit your info
- ✅ **My Giving** - View donations
- ✅ **My Attendance** - View attendance
- ✅ **Logout**

### What Will Be Hidden (until implemented):
- ⏸️ Events (needs member access)
- ⏸️ Chat (needs member access)
- ⏸️ Devotionals (needs member access)
- ⏸️ Prayer Requests (needs member access)
- ⏸️ AI Chat (needs member access)
- ⏸️ Notifications (needs member access)
